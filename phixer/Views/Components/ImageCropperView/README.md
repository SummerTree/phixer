#  Crop/Rotate View

This is based off AKImageCropperView by Artem Krachulov, modified for Swift 4.2 and chnged a little to handle arbitrary rotations and to return the angle of rotation and the crop area, rather than returning a cropped image. That is because phixer needs the transform itself, not the result.
