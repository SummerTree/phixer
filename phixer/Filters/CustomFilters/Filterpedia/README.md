#  Filterpedia

The software here is adapted from the filters provided by the Filterpedia app by Simon Gladwell: https://github.com/FlexMonkey/Filterpedia

The changes I made were essentially:

- convert to Swift 4.2
- redo formatting to match the rest of the code (sorry Simon)
- address conflicts with my own framework (extensions etc.)
- break up code so that there is only one class per file
- modify descriptive text fields to be less verbose (because I sometimes need to display them on an iPhone)
