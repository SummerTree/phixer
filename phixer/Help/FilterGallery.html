<h1>Filter Gallery</h1>


<p>
This screen allows you to choose a sample image to use when browsing through effects.
You can choose from one of the supplied images, or anything in the Photo Library for your device. The selection is remebered through app restarts.
<br>
Controls are the same as the Editor screen, i.e. you can do a split screen preview, togle between the effect and the original, navigate by swiping etc.
<p>This is a little different from the Editor screen in that only a single effect is shown at a time - the intent is for you to be able to browse through the available effects.<br>
<p>
Note that you can also:
<ul>
    <li>rate effects (touch the star icon)</li>
    <li>tag it as a 'favorite' effect (touch the heart icon, it will be shown in the 'favorites' category)</li>
    <li>hide a filter (touch the 'X' icon). This will prevent this filter from being shown in the browser or the 'Color Filters' categories of the Editor.<br>
        Note: you can show hidden filters by changing the corresponding item in Settings, in case you want to unhide them. Hint: the setting is called 'Show Hidden Filters'
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want, you can save the image with the effect applied by selecting the menu icon (top right of screen) and touching save.
