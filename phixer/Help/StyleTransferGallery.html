<h1>Style Transfer Gallery</h1>


<p>
Style Transfer is where we take the style of one image (typically a painting) and apply it to another image.
This is done through Machine Learning models that have been 'trained' using various paintings.<br>
The screen will show you a list of the varius paitings used, and a preview of that style transferred to the current input image (sample or image being edited).<br>
Click on the preview icon to show a bigger version of the effect (which you save if desired).
<p>
<i>Note</i>: this effect takes a while to run (1-2 seconds for each effect) so the screen updates slowly
