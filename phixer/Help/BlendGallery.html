<h1>Blend Gallery</h1>


<p>
This screen shows the built-in images that you can select to use for effects that 'blend' multiple images. There are many types of blends available - if you have used Photoshop or Gimp you are likely familiar with these. You can also select any image on your device to use, so you can blend two of your photos together if desired.
