<h1>Live Filters (Camera Feed)</h1>


<p>
This screen allows you display effects applied to the live camera feed. It works in essentially the same manner as the sample browser or the editor, except that you see the camera feed (front or back). You can also take a picture with the effect applied and it will be saved to the camera Roll.
