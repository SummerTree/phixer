<h1>(Basic) Photo Editor</h1>

<p>
This screen allows to apply multiple effects on top of each other. A set of categories are displayed on the menu at the bottom of the screen,
which will take you to the specific functions available within those categories. Each category will then display a menu of available effects/functions that you can apply.
The functions are broken up into categories like this because otherwise there would just be too many functions in one place and it would be (even more) confusing.
<p>
<h2>Changing Parameters</h2>
Once you select a function, the set of adjustable parameters will be shown and you can change them and see the effects.<br>
    At theis time, there are 3 types of parameters that are shown:
    <ul>
        <li>Scalar parameters (i.e. numbers)<br>
            These are displayed as a slider that you can move and the effect is applied to the image shown.
            </li>
        <li>Colour parameters<br>
            Colour parameters are shown as a hue slider. Move the slide around to select a color and it will be applied - what it does depends on
            which feature you are applying and which parameter you are changing. Note that the slider button will change to the color selected so it's a litle easier to see.
        </li>
        <li>Position parameters<br>
            Position parameters define things like the centre of a vingnette. To change such a parameter, touch the 'pointing hand' symbol next to the parameter name, then touch the screen where you want the parametr to be set. You can move your finger around to see the effect of changing the parameter, but once you lift up your finger then that parameter is no longer active and you have to touch the hand icon to change it again. It is done this way so that the touch gestures for setting a position will not be confused with other gestures (e.g. for navigation).
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>(Not) Saving Effects</h2>
    To 'save' an effect, touch the check mark in the top left corner of the parameters window. Saving in this case means that the filter and its parameters will be kept active and you can then apply other filters. If you don't want to keep the effct then either click the cross icon in the top right of the window, or just navigate to another effect. To undo a saved effect, click on the menu icon in the top right of the screen and choose undo.
    
    <h2>Comparing Effect to the Input</h2>
    Sometimes you may want to compare the image with effects applied to the previous image (with any previously saved filters applied) or the original, unedited image.
    <ul>
        <li>Comparing to previous image<br>
            Touch the split screen icon, next to the check mark icon.
            This will put the display into split screen mode with all filters applied on the left, and all filters except the currently selected filter on the right, i.e. so that you can see the effect of this filter compared to all of the others already applied.
            To move the position of the split screen, touch the displayed image and drag your finger around, and the split will follow your finger. Ooh, isn't this exciting!<br>
            To go back to full screen mode, click on the full screen icon, which has now replaced the split screen icon next to the check mark.<br>
            <i>Note</i>: Do not do this with Style Transfer Effcts. These take a while to run (1-2 seconds each time) so it's really annoying.<br>
            I may actually (eventually) explicitly disable it for slower effects.
        </li>
        <li>Comparing to Original<br>
            To see the original, unedited, image touch the 'crossed out eye' icon next to the cross icon on the right of the parameter window.
            This will then show the original image without any effects applied at all.
            To go back to the filtered image, click the eye icon, which has now replaced the 'crossed out eye' icon.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Navigating</h2>
    You can either navigate by using the selection icons at the bottom of the screen, or you can just swipe left or right to go to the previous or next effect, respectively.
    Note that if you navigate to a new effect, the previous effect is discarded unless you saved it. So, if you are wondering why an effect didn't stay, you probably didn't touch the save (check) icon before changing effects.
    <h2>Saving the Edited Image</h2>
    If you want to save an edited image, touch the menu icon at the top right of the screen and select the save icon. Note that only the 'saved' effects will be applied to the saved image, so remember to save the last filter if you want that applied.
