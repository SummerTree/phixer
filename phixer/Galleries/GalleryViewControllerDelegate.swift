// The intent is to allow galleries to operate as standalone controllers, or as part of a collection of controlllers,
// e.g. as part of a compound editing flow

enum GalleryControllerMode {

// delegate method to let the launching ViewController know that this one has finished
protocol GalleryViewControllerDelegate: class {
