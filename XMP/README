# Processing XMP Sidecar Files

There are thousands of effects available for Phtooshop and Lightroom in the form of XMP files. This directory contains scripts for parsing the XMP files to create filter configurations that can be used with phixer. For now, I will leave the source XMP files here as well for reference

## Installing

pip install python-xmp-toolkit
brew install libxmp
brew install exempi

NOTE: I encountered brew issues. Run this to reset:

brew update-reset

## Running

python convertXMP.py <file>
