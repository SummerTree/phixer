# Processing XMP Sidecar Files

There are thousands of effects available for Photoshop and Lightroom in the form of XMP files.
This directory contains scripts for parsing the XMP files to create filter configurations (presets) that can be used with phixer.

Note: Many/most of these files are licenced (meaning I paid for them and cannot re-distribute), so I cannot include these in the git archive.


## Installing

There is (of course) a python library available for parsing Adobe XMP files, called *python-xmp-toolkit*.
To install (on MacOS):

    pip install python-xmp-toolkit
    brew install libxmp
    brew install exempi

NOTE: I encountered brew issues. Run this to reset:

    brew update-reset


## Running

To convert a Lightroom XMP preset file into the JSON format that is used by pixer, run the following command:

    python convertXMP.py xmpfile jsonfile
    
This will read *xmpfile* and create *jsonfile*. The filenames can include directories

If you need to convert all of the XMP files in the XMP directory tree (i.e. including subdirectories) then there is a script *genconvert.sh*
that searches for any XMP files and creates a bash script to convert them all to JSON preset files (in the Presets directory).
If you do that, don't forget to Add those files to the XCode project.


## Reference

The format used for the Lightroom XMP files is a little mysterious, so here are some links to useful references:
